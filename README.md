# Social Network API
### User Story
As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Description
Social Network API is used for a social network web application where users can ***post***, ***react to their friend's posts***, and ***create a friend list***.

When the server has started, ***Mongoose*** models are synced to the ***MongooseDB*** databases. Users are able to successfully **create, update,** and **delete** users users in my database. They are also able to successfully **create and delete** reactions to thoughts and **add and remove** friends to a userâ€™s friend list

### Here is a **video** of the application working:
